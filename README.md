# Home Assistant AddOn Modbus Proxy
 
Usally one modbus server only allows a single connection and denies any more clients. 
With this Addon you can create a proxy which can handle mutiple client connections at the same time. 
Currently you can configure the Addon to establish a connection to three different Modbus Servers and provide the information to multiple clients through the respective listenport.

The addon is only tested and compatible with hassio supervisor.

- Install ModBusProxy from the Add-On Store

## Configuration
- Stop all Clients that currently connect to the modbus servers. The Server might need some time before another client (our proxy) can connect.
  - In case you are using solaredge-modbus in homeassistant you can change the server address here: /config/.storage/core.config_entries. 
- Before starting go to the configuration page and set the ip of your modbus server. 
- Start The Add-On (This may take a while on the first start as it builds the cointainer locally)
- Configure Your Clients to connect to your HA IP and choosen listenport.
